\begin{abstract}
We describe the motivation, design, and evaluation of the Campus Sherpa app, which helps users create and take custom tours of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) campus. The motivation for the app came from a study where we found a large number of people, such as prospective freshmen, incoming graduate students, tourists, and parents all expressing the need for custom tours of the campus. Our app was designed to address this need by allowing users to create, upload, and take custom tours of the MIT campus. (TODO: INCORPORATE FIELD STUDY RESULTS HERE)

\section{Introduction}

MIT receives a number of visitors each day from various demographics- prospective
undergraduates/graduates, tourists visiting Boston/Cambridge, professionals or researchers
attending a conference on campus, middle school students enrolled in Splash,  etc. Many of
these visitors take campus tours which take them to the main sights at MIT, such as the Student Center, gymnasium, auditorium, main hallway, and architecturally impressive computer science laboratory). However, this ``one size fits all'' nature of the tour fails to take into account the interests of each visitor and show them all the sights that they would enjoy seeing. For instance, it is plausible that a prospective graduate student in biology would like to follow a tour of the biology labs, while a tourist interested in history would like to be taken to the most historically important sites at MIT.

\section{Background}

(TODO: EXPAND SECTION)
Motivated by the above observation, we first identified the types of people touring MIT. We decided that for the purposes of campus tours, we can broadly classify people as current students, prospective freshmen, parents, and tourists. In order to gather information about these groups, we conducted a survey of these four groups, with some questions common to all four groups and some tailored to a specific group. Here are some of the questions we asked (TODO: SHORTEN QUESTION LIST IF NEEDED):

\textbf{Everyone}:

\begin{itemize}
	\item What is the most memorable site you’ve visited here? Why?
	\item What is the one thing you most wish to see here? Why?
	\item Have you gone on a tour of MIT?
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Are there any questions the tour guide didn’t answer?
		\item Did the tour take you everywhere you wanted?
		\item Did the tour leave out any place you wanted to see?
	\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Current Students}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item What are three things you looked for when touring MIT?
	\item What is one place that the tour didn’t cover, which you think tourists should see?
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Prospective Freshman}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item If you could ask a current student one question about MIT, what would it be?
	\item What aspect of MIT do you want explore the most?
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Parents}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item What are three places you want to tour at MIT that you think your child might not want to?
	\item If you could ask a current student one question about MIT, what would it be?
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Tourists}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item How long will you be visiting MIT?
	\item In a sentence, why did you want to come visit MIT?
\end{itemize}

Approximately twenty people responded to the survey, evenly distributed across the four demographics. Some of the responses to the survey are:

``There are always too many things to see \ldots I am wishing I can see more later'' (current student)

``Campus Preview Weekend (CPW) was really rushed, and I did not get to see everything'' (prospective freshman)

``I wish I could get a better sense of MIT culture. The tour guide briefly touched on how each dorm was different, but did not go into detail. '' (prospective freshman)

``I wish they had shown us where the students hang out '' (parent)

``I wish I could get a better sense of MIT culture. The tour guide briefly touched on how each dorm is different, but didn't go into detail. '' (tourist)

From the above responses, we saw that a common complaint was that people were not able to visit places they wanted to with the regular campus tours. In order to solve this problem, we proposed an application that helps create and share custom tours of the MIT campus called ``Campus Sherpa''.

Since smartphones offer location awareness and mobility, they are the obvious platform choice for ``Campus Sherpa''. By deploying this application for iOS, users can take out their smartphone when they arrive at MIT, select a tour based on their interest, and then begin exploring sites that will be most useful to them.

The second aspect of ``Campus Sherpa'' that we wished to support is to allow users to chronicle their tours and share them with others. As prospective students compare MIT to other schools or as tourists reminisce about their visit to MIT, the ability to record their tours (by associating locations with text, photos, videos, and links to related content) will aid them in remembering. For current students, this offers a way to record the precious memories they make at MIT and share them with others. Thus, the primary audience will be people who aim to tour MIT and record their experience there. The secondary audience will be current MIT students who would like to chronicle their lives at MIT.

While some MIT tours will be pre-installed, the majority should be user-created.
Based on our own experiences and the responses to our survey, people have varied tastes and desired destinations when visiting MIT, and we aimed to make sure that their trip to MIT is as enjoyable and productive as possible.

By creating an application to let users create, share, and follow custom tours of MIT, we hope to make college tours custom fit to each person’s taste, to make memories of MIT easy to record and share, and to make a platform for sharing tours.

\section{System Description}

``Campus Sherpa'' allows users to achieve two goals: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Take custom tours
	\item Create tours based on experiences.
\end{itemize}
The app has a number of pages for different tasks, but the three most important tasks that users need to achieve are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Make a Tour
	\item Select a Tour
	\item Take a Tour
	\item Make a Tour
\end{itemize}

We implement a tour as a set of geolocations (i.e. latitude and longitude), each associated with media (i.e. text, links, pictures, audio, video). The interface for making a tour consists of a screen which displays the tour so far - providing a map of the geolocations on the tour. Users can edit geolocations by selecting them on the map, or they can create a new one by clicking a button.

The geolocation creation/edit screen automatically fills in the user’s current location (via GPS) and a default geolocation name. The screen also displays the associated media for the geolocation and buttons to add new media (each of which has its own screen) (TODO: FIGURE FOR CREATE/EDIT)

Users should also be able to select a tour to take. The ``Select a Tour'' screen provides a list of the tours and a means for searching and filtering them. (TODO: FIGURE FOR SELECT TOUR)

The ``Take a Tour'' screen allows users to take tours displays a map of the user’s current location and other locations on the tour. The bottom of the screen includes a set of boxes with thumbnails for the associated media. When the user taps a box, the media is displayed on the screen (TODO: FIGURE FOR TAKE A TOUR)

There are other screens in ``Campus Sherpa'' - a home screen (from which we will launch other screens), a user profile screen, a settings screen, a help screen, etc. (TODO: SOME MISC FIGURE)

\subsection{Technical Details}
We use Parse for the backend. Parse is a backend-as-a-service which provides an SDK for iOS which allows users to persist objects on the server. This is much simpler than building a backend from scratch. For this project, we persist and retrieve latitude/longitude, text, pictures, and audio - which Parse supports. Since this application does not run in a browser, we do not have any browser dependencies (TODO: EXPAND THIS)
    
\section{Page Size and Columns}

On each page your material (not including the page number) should fit
within a rectangle of 18 x 23.5 cm (7 x 9.25 in.), centered on a US
letter page, beginning 1.9 cm (.75 in.) from the top of the page, with
a .85 cm (.33 in.) space between two 8.4 cm (3.3 in.) columns.  Right
margins should be justified, not ragged. Beware, especially when using
this template on a Macintosh, Word can change these dimensions in
unexpected ways. Please be sure that your PDF is US letter and not
A4. If your PDF or paper are formatted for A4, the submission will be
returned to you to fix.

\section{Typeset Text}

Prepare your submissions on a word processor or typesetter.  Please
note that page layout may change slightly depending upon the printer
you have specified.  \LaTeX\ sometimes will create overfull lines
that extend into columns.  To attempt to combat this, the .cls
file has a command, {\textbackslash}sloppy, that essentially asks
\LaTeX\ to prefer underfull lines with extra whitespace.  For more
details on this, and info on how to control it more finely, check out
{\url{http://www.economics.utoronto.ca/osborne/latex/PMAKEUP.HTM}}.

\subsection{Title and Authors}

Your paper's title, authors and affiliations should run across the
full width of the page in a single column 17.8 cm (7 in.) wide.  The
title should be in Helvetica 18-point bold; use Arial if Helvetica is
not available.  Authors' names should be in Times Roman 12-point bold,
and affiliations in Times Roman 12-point.  For more than three authors,
you may have to place some address information in a footnote, or in a named
section at the end of your paper. Please use full international addresses and
telephone dialing prefixes.  Leave one 10-pt line of white space below the last
line of affiliations.

\subsection{Abstract and Keywords}

Every submission should begin with an abstract of about 150 words,
followed by a set of keywords. The abstract and keywords should be
placed in the left column of the first page under the left half of the
title. The abstract should be a concise statement of the problem,
approach and conclusions of the work described.  It should clearly
state the paper's contribution to the field of HCI.

The first set of keywords will be used to index the paper in the
proceedings. The second set are used to catalogue the paper in the ACM
Digital Library. The latter are entries from the ACM Classification
System~\cite{acm_categories}.  In general, it should only be necessary
to pick one or more of the H5 subcategories, see
\url{http://www.acm.org/class/1998/ccs98.html}

\subsection{Normal or Body Text}

Please use a 10-point Times Roman font or, if this is unavailable,
another proportional font with serifs, as close as possible in
appearance to Times Roman 10-point. The Press 10-point font available
to users of Script is a good substitute for Times Roman. If Times
Roman is not available, try the font named Computer Modern Roman. On a
Macintosh, use the font named Times and not Times New Roman. Please
use sans-serif or non-proportional fonts only for special purposes,
such as headings or source code text.

\subsection{First Page Copyright Notice}

Leave 3 cm (1.25 in.) of blank space for the copyright notice at the
bottom of the left column of the first page. In this template a
floating text box will automatically generate the required space. Note
however that the text box is anchored to the \textbf{ABSTRACT}
heading, so if that heading is deleted the text box will disappear as
well.  You can replace the default copyright notice by uncommenting
the {\textbackslash}toappear block at the beginning of the document
and inserting your own text, for example, for versions under review.

\subsection{Subsequent Pages}

On pages beyond the first, start at the top of the page and continue
in double-column format.  The two columns on the last page should be
of equal length.

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{Figure1}
\caption{With Caption Below, be sure to have a good resolution image
  (see item D within the preparation instructions).}
\label{fig:figure1}
\end{figure}

\subsection{References and Citations}

Use a numbered list of references at the end of the article, ordered
alphabetically by first author, and referenced by numbers in brackets
\cite{ethics,
  Klemmer:2002:WSC:503376.503378,
  Mather:2000:MUT,
  Zellweger:2001:FAO:504216.504224}. For
papers from conference proceedings, include the title of the paper and
an abbreviated name of the conference (e.g., for Interact 2003
proceedings, use \textit{Proc. Interact 2003}). Do not include the
location of the conference or the exact date; do include the page
numbers if available. See the examples of citations at the end of this
document. Within this template file, use the \texttt{References} style
for the text of your citation.

Your references should be published materials accessible to the
public.  Internal technical reports may be cited only if they are
easily accessible (i.e., you provide the address for obtaining the
report within your citation) and may be obtained by any reader for a
nominal fee.  Proprietary information may not be cited. Private
communications should be acknowledged in the main text, not referenced
(e.g., ``[Robertson, personal communication]'').

\begin{table}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    \tabhead{Objects} &
    \multicolumn{1}{|p{0.3\columnwidth}|}{\centering\tabhead{Caption --- pre-2002}} &
    \multicolumn{1}{|p{0.4\columnwidth}|}{\centering\tabhead{Caption --- 2003 and afterwards}} \\
    \hline
    Tables & Above & Below \\
    \hline
    Figures & Below & Below \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Table captions should be placed below the table.}
  \label{tab:table1}
\end{table}

\section{Sections}

The heading of a section should be in Helvetica 9-point bold, all in
capitals. Use Arial if Helvetica is not available. Sections should
not be numbered.

\subsection{Subsections}

Headings of subsections should be in Helvetica 9-point bold with
initial letters capitalized.  For
sub-sections and sub-subsections, a word like \emph{the} or \emph{of}
is not capitalized unless it is the first word of the heading.)

\subsubsection{Sub-subsections}

Headings for sub-subsections should be in Helvetica 9-point italic
with initial letters capitalized.  Standard {\textbackslash}section,
{\textbackslash}subsection, and {\textbackslash}subsubsection commands
will work fine.

\section{Figures/Captions}

Place figures and tables at the top or bottom of the appropriate
column or columns, on the same page as the relevant text
(see Figure~\ref{fig:figure1}). A figure or table may extend across both
columns to a maximum width of 17.78 cm (7 in.).

Captions should be Times New Roman 9-point bold.  They should be numbered (e.g.,
``Table~\ref{tab:table1}'' or ``Figure~\ref{fig:figure2}''), centered
and placed beneath the figure or table.  Please note that the words
``Figure'' and ``Table'' should be spelled out (e.g., ``Figure''
rather than ``Fig.'') wherever they occur.

Papers and notes may use color figures, which are included in the page
limit; the figures must be usable when printed in black and white in
the proceedings.  The paper may be accompanied by a short video figure
up to five minutes in length.  However, the paper should stand on its
own without the video figure, as the video may not be available to
everyone who reads the paper.

\section{Language, Style and Content}

The written and spoken language of SIGCHI is English. Spelling and
punctuation may use any dialect of English (e.g., British, Canadian,
US, etc.) provided this is done consistently. Hyphenation is
optional. To ensure suitability for an international audience, please
pay attention to the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Write in a straightforward style.
\item Try to avoid long or complex sentence structures.
\item Briefly define or explain all technical terms that may be
  unfamiliar to readers.
\item Explain all acronyms the first time they are used in your text---e.g.,
``Digital Signal Processing (DSP)''.
\item Explain local references (e.g., not everyone knows all city
  names in a particular country).
\item Explain ``insider'' comments. Ensure that your whole audience
  understands any reference whose meaning you do not describe (e.g.,
  do not assume that everyone has used a Macintosh or a particular
  application).
\item Explain colloquial language and puns. Understanding phrases like
  ``red herring'' may require a local knowledge of English.  Humor and
  irony are difficult to translate.
\item Use unambiguous forms for culturally localized concepts, such as
  times, dates, currencies and numbers (e.g., ``1-5-97'' or ``5/1/97''
  may mean 5 January or 1 May, and ``seven o'clock'' may mean 7:00 am or
  19:00).  For currencies, indicate equivalences---e.g., ``Participants
  were paid 10,000 lire, or roughly \$5.''
\item Be careful with the use of gender-specific pronouns (he, she)
  and other gendered words (chairman, manpower, man-months). Use
  inclusive language that is gender-neutral (e.g., she or he, they,
  s/he, chair, staff, staff-hours,
  person-years). See~\cite{Schwartz:1995:GBF} for further advice and
  examples regarding gender and other personal attributes.
\item If possible, use the full (extended) alphabetic character set
  for names of persons, institutions, and places (e.g.,
  Gr{\o}nb{\ae}k, Lafreni\'ere, S\'anchez, Universit{\"a}t,
  Wei{\ss}enbach, Z{\"u}llighoven, \r{A}rhus, etc.).  These characters
  are already included in most versions of Times, Helvetica, and Arial
  fonts.
\end{itemize}

\section{Accessibility}
The Executive Council of SIGCHI has committed to making SIGCHI conferences more inclusive for researchers, practitioners, and educators with disabilities. As a part of this goal, the all authors are asked to work on improving the accessibility of their submissions. Specifically, we encourage authors to carry out the following five steps:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Add alternative text to all figures
	\item Mark table headings
	\item Add tags to the PDF
	\item Verify the default language
	\item Set the tab order to ``Use Document Structure''
\end{enumerate}
Unfortunately good tools do not yet exist to create tagged PDF files from Latex. LaTeX users will need to carry out all of the above steps in the PDF directly using Adobe Acrobat, after the PDF has been generated.
 
For more information and links to instructions and resources, please see:
{\url{http://chi2014.acm.org/authors/guide-to-an-accessible-submission}}.

\section{Page Numbering, Headers and Footers}

Please submit your anonymous version for reviewing with page numbers
centered in the footer.  These must be removed in the final version of
accepted papers, as page numbers, headers, and footers will be added
by the conference printers.  Comment out the {\textbackslash}pagenumbering
command at the top of the document to remove page numbers.

\section{Producing and Testing PDF Files}

We recommend that you produce a PDF version of your submission well
before the final deadline.  Your PDF file must be ACM DL
Compliant. The requirements for an ACM Compliant PDF are available at:
{\url{http://www.sheridanprinting.com/typedept/ACM-distilling-settings.htm}}.

Test your PDF file by viewing or printing it with the same software we
will use when we receive it, Adobe Acrobat Reader Version 7. This is
widely available at no cost from~\cite{acrobat}.  Note that most
reviewers will use a North American/European version of Acrobat
reader, which cannot handle documents containing non-North American or
non-European fonts (e.g. Asian fonts).  Please therefore do not use
Asian fonts, and verify this by testing with a North American/European
Acrobat reader (obtainable as above). Something as minor as including
a space or punctuation character in a two-byte font can render a file
unreadable.

\section{Blind Review}

For archival submissions, CHI requires a ``blind review.'' To prepare
your submission for blind review, remove author and institutional
identities in the title and header areas of the paper. You may also
need to remove part or all of the Acknowledgments text.  Further
suppression of identity in the body of the paper and references is
left to the authors' discretion. For more details, see the submission
guidelines and checklist for your submission category.

\section{Conclusion}

It is important that you write for the SIGCHI audience.  Please read
previous years' Proceedings to understand the writing style and
conventions that successful authors have used.  It is particularly
important that you state clearly what you have done, not merely what
you plan to do, and explain how your work is different from previously
published work, i.e., what is the unique contribution that your work
makes to the field?  Please consider what the reader will learn from
your submission, and how they will find your work useful.  If you
write with these questions in mind, your work is more likely to be
successful, both in being accepted into the Conference, and in
influencing the work of our field.
